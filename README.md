This work is based on old version of NerfAcc, which has upgraded greatly. So it might does **not work** now.  
If you are interested in adding NerfAcc into your code, you can refer to [this project](https://github.com/bennyguo/instant-nsr-pl).  
Also, [NeRF Studio](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio) supports a more interpretable implementation of NeRFs by modularizing each component.
